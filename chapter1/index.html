    Oh Matcha, you are my favorite beverage, my gentle ritual at the start of every day. I love your earthy smell, your vibrant green color, and the way you make me feel both calm and energized. In your warmth, I find comfort and clarity. Each sip feels like a quiet moment of peace and calm. 
    
    Love,
    A Matcha Lover 💚⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
